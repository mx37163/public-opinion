A transparent governance &amp; discussion system for the Savior Commonwealth.

What is Savior?

I am Ma Junjian.

I am building a transnational commonwealth where members can get basic living security without working or paying.

Basic needs including food, clothing, housing, water, electricity, and internet are provided for all members, regardless of country or region.

This does not mean no cost.

The condition is also the core of feasibility:

Voluntarily give up partial privacy.

Members must disclose income, consumption, production, and daily life that does not violate public order.

Those who do not agree to privacy disclosure cannot join, but can still benefit from the positive changes brought by the system.

This commonwealth is called:

Savior.

Commonwealth Structure

- Di (Earth): Basic living security, no work required.

- Xuan (Mystery): Basic living security, voluntary work to create resources.

- Huang (Human): Basic living security, work and participate in governance.

- Tian (Heaven): People who know Savior but do not join (automatically become external supporters).

Status in the commonwealth is determined by contribution, not by power or background.

Feasibility

The system is feasible because of full transparency:

- Automatic join: those who agree to disclose privacy.

- Automatic exit: those who refuse to disclose privacy.

If resources are insufficient in the early stage, the commonwealth owes members the basic security and will repay later.

Transparency eliminates corruption.

Low trust cost reduces overall social transaction costs.

The saved resources fund basic living security.

This is the economic foundation of Savior.

Vision

After the system runs:

- No one is forced to work to survive.

- No fraud, no corruption, no hidden injustice.

- Unemployment no longer means life crisis.

- Ordinary people can truly live with dignity.

Savior is not utopia.

It is a practical, voluntary, non-coercive, human-friendly social improvement.

Savior vs Utopia

- Utopia assumes people want to work. Savior assumes people want happiness.

- Utopia uses coercion. Savior respects full voluntariness.

- Utopia needs unlimited resources. Savior only needs reduced transaction costs.

- Utopia is against human nature. Savior is aligned with human nature.

- Utopia is impossible. Savior is achievable.

Public Opinion: The Tool for Savior

To support transparency and governance, I built a tool called:

Public Opinion (公论)

It is:

- A non-linear message & discussion system

- A transparent decision-making system

- A governance engine for the Savior Commonwealth

Core:

- Non-linear structure

- Contribution points (digital currency)

- Smart contract rules

Everything is recorded permanently.

Everything is traceable. Truth is public.

Features

- Parallel topics without chaos

- Reference multiple messages at once

- Auto-collapse, summarize, and organize information

- Track unread content automatically

- Support voting, standing, and position statistics

- Permanent log, modification traceable

- Shortcuts for keyboard; gestures for touchscreens

Incentive Mechanism

Contribution Points are issued to encourage:

- Real discussion

- Fact-checking

- Valuable participation

- Rational judgment

Members can bet points on facts, opinions, and judgments.

Winners gain; fraud and wrong information lose.

The system rewards truth, punishes deception.

This forms a self-improving transparent ecosystem.

Core Principle

One thing only:

Everything is recorded.

Justice and truth will be known by all.

With two tools:

- Non-linear display & interaction system

- Contribution point digital currency
